# Mahjong-Profit-Counter

A python GUI application made using tkinter package that can track the profits of players during a Mahjong game.
At the end, the application provides a summary of the profits of each player as well as a graph of how profits has changed throughout the course of the game. 

## Limitations 
1. Every player must have DISTINCT names
2. Counting methods include: 1/2 or 3/6 ONLY; Shooter pay 
3. Maximum tai is 5 
4. Once an entry is keyed in, cannot delete or edit entries 
5. Once 'End Game'  > 'See results' is clicked, the tracking stops (i.e. Cannot check how much the profits of each player is until the game ends)
